# hackerrank-automation
Hacker Rank automation is a basic project created in order to learn how web automation works.
This project opens hacker rank site and then logs in using config json file(it is a testing userid and password).
Then it opens alot of contests and add one person (details in config json file) as a cohost of the contest.
If this task is done manually , it will waste a lot of time and is useless manual labour. Instead i just created an automated process which 
will do the given task on its own without using physical labour
